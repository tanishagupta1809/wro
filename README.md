# Waste Route Optimizer

## Overview
Waste Route Optimizer is a backend-focused optimization project designed to compute efficient waste collection routes using graph-based algorithms. The system aims to reduce travel distance and improve operational efficiency in waste management systems.

## Features
- Route optimization using graph traversal techniques
- Modular C++ implementation
- Python integration for higher-level interaction
- Clean separation of core logic and interfaces

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C++, Python
- **Concepts:** Graph Algorithms, Route Optimization
- **Tools:** CMake
- **Optional Integrations:** Database handling, dashboards

## How It Works
- The system models locations as nodes in a graph.
- Optimized routes are calculated using shortest-path techniques.
- Python bindings allow easier experimentation and visualization.

## Future Enhancements
- Machine Learning–based route prediction
- JNI integration for Java applications
- Real-time data ingestion
- Frontend dashboard for live monitoring
